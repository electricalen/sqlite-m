/** @mainpage sqlite-m
 sqlite-m is a collection of Objective-C wrapper classes for various sqlite3
 structures.
 
 This library is meant to be as close as possible to sqlite3's design, while
 supporting core types such as NSString and NSNumber and using Objective-C
 messaging and memory management.
